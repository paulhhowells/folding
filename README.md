folding
=======

Take a look at index.html to see an example of Folding Layout Patterns being applied between breakpoints.

folding.css provides a minimal block of CSS providing four Folding Patterns (without breakpoints).

layout/folding.less provides mixins that generate the same four Folding Patterns, optionally constrained to min-width and max-width breakpoints.


to do
-----
* cross browser test
* merge into the Unit layout project
* add more patterns?
